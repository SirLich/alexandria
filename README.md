# <b>alexandria</b> : mock RSS for discord.

alexandria is a simple mock RSS feed for discord. Each supported service is developed from scratch using Beautifull Soup and a simple discord embed library. This is to insure maximum cleanliness of the final product.

## Current support:

alexandria is still in its infant stages, and therefore only supports the Minecraft Forums.

## How to run:
Not included in this repository are three vital files which must be included before the project can be run:

1) A copy of [dhooks](https://github.com/kyb3r/dhooks).

2) A blacklist.txt file. This file can be created as an empty, but will be used to store information on which news-items have already been posted.

3) A webhooks.txt file. This file should contain the list of discord web-hook URL's you wish to post embeds to. One per line.


## The future:

alexandria was a fun project to develop, and I see myself adding support for more services, easier setup, and better control in the future. For now, it is a stable and easy to run discord embed server for Minecraft updates, as published on the MC forums.
